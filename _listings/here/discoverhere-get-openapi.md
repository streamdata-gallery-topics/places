    The `discover/here` endpoint allow users to request a list of places near to a given point, based on a location precision parameter (in this case the `at` parameter) which must be provided.

    * **app_id**  `text`
     \- A 20 byte Base64 URL-safe encoded string used for the authentication of the client application.    You must include an `app_id` with every request.

    * **app_code**  `text`
     \- A 20 byte Base64 URL-safe encoded string used for the authentication of the client application.    You must include an `app_code` with every request.
